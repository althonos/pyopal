## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

[Opal](https://github.com/Martinsos/opal) is a sequence aligner enabling fast
sequence similarity search using either of the Smith-Waterman, semi-global or
Needleman-Wunsch algorithms.

PyOpal is a Python module that provides bindings to [Opal](https://github.com/Martinsos/opal)
using [Cython](https://cython.org/). It implements a user-friendly, Pythonic
interface to query a database of sequences and access the search results. It
interacts with the Opal interface rather than with the CLI, which has the
following advantages:

- **no binary dependency**: PyOpal is distributed as a Python package, so 
  you can add it as a dependency to your project, and stop worrying about the
  Opal binary being present on the end-user machine.
- **no intermediate files**: Everything happens in memory, in a Python object
  you control, so you don't have to invoke the Opal CLI using a sub-process
  and temporary files.
- **better portability**: Opal uses SIMD to accelerate alignment scoring, but
  doesn't support dynamic dispatch, so it has to be compiled on the local
  machine to be able to use the full capabilities of the local CPU. PyOpal
  ships several versions of Opal instead, each compiled with different target
  features, and selects the best one for the local platform at runtime.
- **wider platform support**: The Opal code has been backported to work on SSE2
  rather than SSE4.1, allowing PyOpal to run on older x86 CPUs (all x86 CPUs
  support it since 2003). In addition, Armv7 and Aarch64 CPUs are also
  supported if they implement NEON extensions.

## üîß Installing

PyOpal is available for all modern versions (3.6+), depending only 
on the lightweight Python package [`archspec`](https://pypi.org/project/archspec) 
for runtime CPU feature detection.

It can be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyopal/),
which hosts some pre-built x86-64 and Aarch64 wheels for Linux and MacOS,
as well as the code required to compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install pyopal
```

<!-- Otherwise, PyOpal is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda pyopal
``` -->

## üí° Example

Create a database from some reference sequences:
```python
import pyopal

database = pyopal.Database([
    "MESILDLQELETSEEESALMAASTVSNNC",                         # goadvionin A
    "MKKAVIVENKGCATCSIGAACLVDGPIPDFEIAGATGLFGLWG",           # subtilosin A
    "MAGFLKVVQILAKYGSKAVQWAWANKGKILDWINAGQAIDWVVEKIKQILGIK", # lacticin Z
    "MTQIKVPTALIASVHGEGQHLFEPMAARCTCTTIISSSSTF",             # plantazolicin
])
```

Then search it with a query sequence, and show the target sequence with the
highest score:
```python
results = database.search("MAGFLKVVQLLAKYGSKAVQWAWANKGKILDWLNAGQAIDWVVSKIKQILGIK")
best = max(results, key=lambda result: result.score)
print(best.score, best.target_index, database[best.target_index])
```

You can also get the alignment for every target, but this must be enabled
when searching the database:
```python
results = database.search("MESVLDLQELETSEEESALMAASTISQNC", mode="full")
for result in results:
    print(result.score, result.identity(), result.cigar())
```

## üß∂ Thread-safety

`Database` objects are thread safe through a
[C++17 read/write lock](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_mutex)
that prevents modification while the database is searched. In addition, the
`Database.search`  method is re-entrant and can be safely used to query the same
database in parallel with different queries across different threads:

```python
import multiprocessing.pool
import pyopal
import Bio.SeqIO

queries = [
    "MEQQIELDVLEISDLIAGAGENDDLAQVMAASCTTSSVSTSSSSSSS",
    "MTQIKVPTALIASVHGEGQHLFEPMAARCTCTTIISSSSTF",
    "MGAIAKLVAKFGWPIVKKYYKQIMQFIGEGWAINKIIDWIKKHI",
    "MGPVVVFDCMTADFLNDDPNNAELSALEMEELESWGAWDGEATS",
]

database = pyopal.Database([
    str(record.seq)
    for record in Bio.SeqIO.parse("vendor/opal/test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta", "fasta")
])

with multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool() as pool:
    hits = dict(pool.map(lambda q: (q, database.search(q)), queries))
```
