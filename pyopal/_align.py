    """Align the query sequence to every database sequence in parallel.

    Arguments:
        query (`str` or byte-like object): The sequence to query the
            database with.
        database (iterable of `str` or byte-like objects): The database 
            sequences to align the query to.
        score_matrix (`~pyopal.ScoreMatrix`): The scoring matrix
            to use for the alignment.

    Keyword Arguments:
        gap_open(`int`): The gap opening penalty :math:`G` for
            scoring the alignments.
        gap_extend (`int`): The gap extension penalty :math:`E`
            for scoring the alignments.
        mode (`str`): The search mode to use for querying the database:
            ``score`` to only report scores for each hit (default),
            ``end`` to report scores and end coordinates for each
            hit (slower), ``full`` to report scores, coordinates and
            alignment for each hit (slowest).
        overflow (`str`): The strategy to use when a sequence score
            overflows in the comparison pipeline: ``simple`` computes
            scores with 8-bit range first then recomputes with 16-bit
            range (and then 32-bit) the sequences that overflowed;
            ``buckets`` to divide the targets in buckets, and switch
            to larger score ranges within a bucket when the first
            overflow is detected.
        algorithm (`str`): The alignment algorithm to use: ``nw``
            for global Needleman-Wunsch alignment, ``hw`` for semi-global
            alignment without penalization of gaps on query edges, ``ov``
            for semi-global alignment without penalization of gaps on
            query or target edges, and ``sw`` for local Smith-Waterman
            alignment.
        threads (`int`): The number of threads to use for aligning
            sequences in parallel. If zero is given, uses the number
            of threads reported by `os.cpu_count`. If one given, use
            the main threads for aligning, otherwise spawns a 
            `multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool`.
        pool (`multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool`): A running pool 
            instance to use for parallelization. Useful for reusing 
            the same pool across several calls of `~pyopal.align`. 
            If `None` give, spawns a new pool based on the ``threads``
            argument.

    Yields:
        `~pyopal.ScoreResult`: Results for the alignment of the query
        to each target sequence in the database. The actual type depends 
        on the requested ``mode``: it will be `ScoreResult` for mode 
        ``score``, `EndResult` for mode ``end`` and `FullResult` for 
        mode ``full``.

    Example:
        >>> targets = ["AACCGCTG", "ATGCGCT", "TTATTACG"]
        >>> for result in pyopal.align("ACCTG", targets, gap_open=2):
        ...     print(result.score, targets[result.target_index])
        41 AACCGCTG
        31 ATGCGCT
        23 TTATTACG
